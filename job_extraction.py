    This university offers various courses in engineering and sciences, including:
    - Computer Science and Engineering (CSE): Covers foundational and advanced concepts in computing.
    - Data Science (DS): Applies machine learning and statistical methods to analyze data.
    - Artificial Intelligence (AI): Focuses on creating intelligent systems and algorithms.
-You are a postgraduate student in Computer Science planning your course schedule for the upcoming semester. You aim to optimize your learning experience while staying within specific constraints, including the type of assessments, grading policy and group/individual preferences for each course. Each task introduces a distinct situation with defined preferences and challenges and factors such as course popularity, add/drop policies, and restrictions may influence your choices. Use the AI systemâ€™s suggestions to make decisions, but the final choice is yours.
